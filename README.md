youtube browser block
This is a hobby project and I will work on this at will
Basic idea
-build something that affects the browser window.
-lets the main page take up most of the screen
-cuts out a window to play youtube on the same screen with out
having to alter the browser window size. 
-This window containing the youtube video should not be limited to location
and will have a default placement but ultimately will be at the users discression.
